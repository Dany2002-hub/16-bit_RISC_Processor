# RISC_Processor
This repository presents the Verilog code for a 16-bit RISC processor, which is designed based on its instruction set and Harvard-type datapath architecture. The instruction set of this RISC processor has 13 different instructions from the 3 broader types - Memory Access Instructions, Data Processing Instructions, and Control Flow Instructions. Further, this code was simulated in both EDA Playground and Xilinx Vivado.
